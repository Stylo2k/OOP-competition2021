## Hi in this short overview I will inform you on what I have done and you can expect.

The first picture is the Aircraft Editor from the assignements F.L.A.P.S. I changed two things here for this competition.

This is how it looks when a fuel tank is selected :

This is how it looks when a cargo area is selected :

The things I added/changed :

* 1 : The passengers entrence (adding passengers on board)
![Passengers](images/readme/PassengersChosen.PNG)
  What I added is that the passengers from each category now get a randomzied pice for the ticket. Adults always have to pay more than 12+ and the latter more than 12-.
  Ofcourse the sum of theses tickets is added to the profit.
* 2: The un/re do manager
  The un/re do manager is now perfected. Prevouisly the mager was initiated when the editor frame was opened. Now however each aircraft that gets selected gets its own manager.   This way you can still undo previous action taken even after closing the configration frame of the aircraft. In addition to the fact that the program now jumps back to the right configuration panel (cargo, fuel, passengers) and the exact previosly selected point is reselected.
